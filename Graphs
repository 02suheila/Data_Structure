1.UNDIRECTED GRAPH: it acts as bidirectional graph
characteristics:
symmetry,connectivity
->DEPTH FOR SEARCH
->BREADTH FOR SEARCH: calulate adj list from edges-make unvisited array- append a value into deque-make as marked -pop it- for pop value make as marked in adjancency list

2.BIDIRECTED GRAPH: it acts as unidirection graph
char:unsymmetry,connectivity
->TOPOLOGICAL SORT
->DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM
